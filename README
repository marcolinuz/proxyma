Hello all,

This is my little project "Proxyma".
It's a multiple reverse-proxy implementation with basic url-rewriting capabilities.
It's not perfect, but can handle most of the pages (and web applications) that I have tested.

NOTE: this is a beta-version (0.5) and is released under the GPL license
(see the LICENSE file for more informations)

Requirements:
You neeed "ant" and Java to build this project
You need also a running Servlet Container like tomcat, jetty, ecc..
to deploy the web-application.

Binary Distribution:
I added to this package a "dist" directory where you can find the
compiled packages.

Getting started:
 * Enter into the project directory (cd proxyma)

 * Due to the use of backports for Concurrent utils, I have 2
   different targets to buil the project based upon your Java Virtual Machine.
   type: "ant -f ./ant/build.xml" to build both versions.
   You can use the 1.4 build even on a 1.5 VM, but if you want best performance
   i suggest you to use the proper version.

 * Deploy the generated proxyma-0.3.war file into your application server.

 * go to the url of proxyma and click on the link "Proxyma Console"

 * Add a rule (to begin you can use the default rule :O)

 * Click on the generated rule and surf the site with proxyma.

 A special Thanks to Arthur Blake (arthur.blake@gmail.com) for his help ;O)

 RELEASE NOTES: (Proxyma 0.5)
------------------------------
 * Introduced a ReverseProxyForServlets Class to simplify the deploy of proxyma
   into custom web-applications.

 * Introduced by Arthur Blake and revisited by me all the Audit functionality. 
   Now we can select between two kinds of logging for Debug: 
   on-line and on-file. 

 * Introduced a new logging policy: "Production" that creates an access log
   of clients requestts in Common Logging Format 
   (so you can use it with third party log analyzers). 

------------------------------
 RELEASE NOTES: (Proxyma 0.3)
------------------------------

 In this release I made a massive refactory of the whole project and now 
 Proxyma has the following new features.

 * Introduced full support for multiple proxy target, now you can masquerade
   many hosts wiht the same instance of proxyma.
   Note that this support is cross/rule enabled. So if a page has a link that
   points to another resource proxed by another rule, it will be rewritten in
   according to that rule.
 * Introduced support to change, add, remove, pause, ecc.. the proxy targets
   on-the-fly BO)
 * Introduced a Configuration Console to manage multiple rules
 * Introduced a feature that makes proxyma show you the current available
   rules. You only need to browse to the base path of the
   HttpReverseProxyServlet..  (see the web.xml file for more info)
 * Introduced optimizations for java 5 and java 4 (via backports util libraries)
 * Introduced apache commons library for BASE64 Encoding/Decoding
 * Improoved the proxy API with a RuleFactory that could be useful for manage
   rules persistence.
 * Added a section into web.xml that helps you to add basic protection to the
   configuration console (on tomcat).
 * Added support for some non-standard attributes that works on MSIE, Netscape and Firefox.
