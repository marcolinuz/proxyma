Hello all,

This is my little project "Proxyma".
It's a multiple reverse-proxy implementation with a smart cache and basic url-rewriting capabilities.
It's not perfect, but can handle most of the pages (and web applications) that I tested.

NOTE: this is a complete rewrite of the whole project. So, in other words,
it will NOT be compatible with the latest release poblished (0.9).

The new project is splitted into 3 modules:
 - proxyma-core -> the core library to use into your own applications
 - proxyma-webapp -> a simple webapp that uses the core library to deploy a
                     reverse proxy into any servlet container.
 - proxyma-config -> a simple web front-end to configure the proxy folders into
                     proxyma-webapp

As always, it's released under the GPL license. 
(see the LICENSE file for more informations)

Requirements:
You neeed "maven 2" and Java to build this project
You need also a running Servlet Container like tomcat, jetty, glassfish, ecc..
to deploy the web-application.

Sorry, no binary distribution is available yet.

Getting started:
 * Enter into the project directory (cd proxyma)

 * Load the project into NetBeans or simply type: "mvn install" to build the 
   whole project.

 * Deploy the generated proxyma-webapp.war and proxyma-config.war files into 
   your application server.

 * go to the url of proxyma-config and the "Proxyma Console" will appear.

 * Add a rule (to begin you can use the default rule :O)

 * Click on the generated rule and surf the site with proxyma.
